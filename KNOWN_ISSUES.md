# CavemanPrototype — Known Issues & Cleanup Log

A running record so progress/problems don't get lost. Newest first. Move items to
**Fixed** when done. Maintained alongside the code — see DESIGN.md for the roadmap.

## Fixed
- **2026-06-23 — Resources teleported to warehouses.** Buffer→storage was instant.
  Now physical: build a **Mammoth Shack** (`TransportHub`) and assign workers who
  become **Transporters** that carry goods from collector/workshop buffers to storage.
  (Note: workshop *inputs* are still pulled from the global pool, not hauled — see Open.)
- **2026-06-23 — Builders hogged all workers.** Each construction site claimed up
  to 3 free workers, starving resource collectors and making it impossible to keep
  gathering during a build. Reworked: builders are now a **capped HQ job**
  (`Colony.MaxBuilders`, default 2), auto-filled when construction exists, and
  manually adjustable from the Town Hall (HQ) panel. Sites are serviced by the
  shared builder squad rather than each grabbing workers.
- **2026-06-23 — Two scenes** (empty `SampleScene` vs working scene). Removed the
  unused template; `UnitySave.unity` is the working scene.

## Fixed (continued)
- **2026-06-23 — Population died fast & silently (ran out of water).** Slowed food/
  water consumption, bigger starting buffers (90 each), slower decline (more grace),
  and a big on-screen ⚠ warning when out of food/water.

## Open — routes (MVP built — iterate)
- Caravan routes are point-to-point (elephant shuttles A↔B along a straight line, no
  laid track). Next: **track/path laying** (vehicle follows it; placement puzzle),
  **vehicle tiers by age** (elephant → cart → **train**, faster/bigger), route **load
  filters**, multi-stop routes, and a route-management panel. The old `TransportHub`/
  `Transporter` classes are now unused (no buildables) — remove in a cleanup.

## Open — belts (strong now — iterate)
- Belts: place/drag with **auto-direction** (path + corners), building→belt→storage
  **and** building→belt→**workshop input** (workshops consume belt-fed inputs before
  the pool). Buildings snap to the belt grid. Haulers range-limited.
- Belts now: **don't run when disconnected** (dead-end = red, won't pull), **two speed
  tiers** (Wooden/Conveyor), and build-menu **tooltips** explain each building.
- **BIGGEST remaining (next focused batch): multi-cell building footprints + explicit
  input/output port sides.** Buildings are 1 cell, so only 4 belt connections and no
  size variety. Want: buildings sized by function (e.g. 2×2 workshop, big warehouse),
  with dedicated output/input port cells (facing, rotatable) — belts must connect to
  the right slot. This is the spatial-challenge depth the player is asking for; it's a
  sizeable subsystem (footprint occupancy, ports, markers, belt port-aware I/O) best
  done as its own carefully-iterated batch.
- Other belt items: **splitters/junctions/undergrounds**; **collector tiers** (manual→
  machine); **item groups** so a storage holds a category (all "lumber"); re-gate belts.

## Open — bugs / behaviour
- **Workshop inputs & build costs still pull from the global pool, not hauled.**
  Buffer→storage is now physical (Transporters), but a workshop's *inputs* and a
  build site's *materials* are taken from the combined pool regardless of distance.
  Next: route inputs through transport too (and conveyors).
- *(Fixed 2026-06-23)* ~~Build menu doesn't scale~~ — now a categorised, scrollable,
  clickable menu (Gathering / Workshops / Logistics / Storage / Housing). Number keys
  1–9 + 0 remain as shortcuts. Categories are derived from building kind for now;
  finer "industries" sub-grouping can come later.
- **No food variety yet.** Berries (bushes) exist as "Food"; planned: **meat** from
  **animals** (moving/huntable node) with distinct gathering + storage + spoilage.
- **Transporters have no priorities.** They grab the nearest available job; no way to
  say "prioritise food" or set source→destination routes. Needed for real logistics
  (and for conveyors later).
- **No terrain / paths.** Flat background only; planned ground tiles + player-laid
  paths/roads (cosmetic first, then speed/route function).
- **Reducing builders mid-haul wastes a little.** A removed builder drops its claim
  (the picked-up units were already spent); another re-fetches. Rare, low impact.
- **HQ (Town Hall) can be demolished**, which would break builder management and
  drop the starting pop cap. Should be protected from demolition.

## Optimisation done
- *(2026-06-23)* Belts no longer scan every building each tick — buildings register
  their cell in `WorldGrid` (cell→building dicts) so belt pickup/delivery/connection
  checks are O(1). Item-on-belt shown as one pooled sliding dot per belt (cheap).

## Open — optimisation / redundancy
- **Collector/Workshop duplication [biggest].** `ProductionBuilding` and
  `WorkshopBuilding` duplicate `PushToStorage` / `DrawLink` / `UpdateVisual` / flash
  handling. Extract a shared base class (e.g. `OutputBuilding`). Deferred to a
  dedicated refactor to avoid destabilising feature batches.
- **Worker/BuilderWorker duplication.** Shared `MoveTo` / `NearestHousing` /
  `UpdateColor` movement helpers could live in a common base.
- *(Improved 2026-06-23)* HUD perf: `Economy.Totals()` is now cached once per frame
  (was ~2×/frame), and the build menu only runs its per-building affordability checks
  while it's open (B-toggled). Remaining: per-idle-transporter `FindJob` scans the
  building registries each frame — fine for now, revisit if building counts get large.

## Open — design
- **Too automated / not enough choice** — *partly addressed*: ages now force choices
  (what to build toward, advance when ready), transporter **priorities** added, and
  food **variety→productivity** rewards decisions. Still want: worker job priorities,
  layout that matters more, branching (not just linear) tech.

## Open — onboarding / UX
- **Too much at once at the start.** All buildings/categories are visible immediately,
  which is a lot for a new player. Plan: progressive unlock (via ages) so early game
  shows only a few options, plus a cleaner first-run / tidier build panel.

## Open — content / polish (deliberately deferred)
- Placeholder art (code-drawn shapes, debug `OnGUI` HUD). One real art pass once
  the systems are locked.
- LF/CRLF warnings on commit — cosmetic, handled by `.gitattributes`.

## Process
Run a quick optimisation/redundancy pass roughly every few feature batches and
append findings here; fix the safe/high-value ones immediately, log the rest.
