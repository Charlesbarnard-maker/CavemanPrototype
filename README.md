# Caveman Prototype

A 2D factory/automation game (Unity 6, URP): start as a caveman doing everything by hand and
evolve across ages (Stone → Tribal → Bronze → Iron → Industrial → speculative future) into
self-running, logistics-driven systems. Inspirations: Factorio, Satisfactory, Spore.

## How to run
- **Unity `6000.5.0f1`**, 2D (URP). Open the project, then open the scene **`Assets/UnitySave.unity`**
  and press **Play**. (If you see a blank/blue screen you're on the wrong scene — open that one.)
- The **entire game is built in code at runtime** by `GameBootstrap` (one component on one
  GameObject). There is **no Inspector wiring and no prefabs** — to change content you edit code in
  `Assets/Scripts/`. Placeholder art is generated procedurally (`PlaceholderArt`). Art pass is last.

## Where the design lives (read in this order)
1. **[GAME_DESIGN.md](GAME_DESIGN.md)** — canonical system synthesis (audit, the unifying rules,
   age model, interaction map, implementation order). **This wins over the per-system docs.**
2. Per-system detail: [AGES](AGES.md) · [WORLD](WORLD.md) · [LIQUIDS](LIQUIDS.md) ·
   [CONSTRUCTION](CONSTRUCTION.md) · [BUILD_SYSTEMS](BUILD_SYSTEMS.md) · [DESIGN](DESIGN.md)
3. **[KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)** — running log of bugs, tuning watchpoints, and what's
   built vs deferred. Keep it current.

The one rule that ties it together: **"stored, not summoned"** — resources are only usable once
logistics delivers them to storage/HQ/your hands; nothing teleports. Each age changes *how*
logistics works, never *what* the loop is.

## Current build status (what's actually in the game)
- **Ages** Stone→Tribal→Bronze→Iron→Industrial (advance costs pop+resources). Power is the
  Industrial constraint. (Mid-age rule-shifts + future ages are designed, partly built.)
- **Economy** "stored, not summoned" (`Economy.StoredOnly`) — usable pool = carried + storages;
  local production for workshops (adjacent/belt-fed).
- **Solids logistics** hand-carry → belts (drag, auto-corner, I/O **ports**: output arrow / input
  notch, rotate R) → depots + caravan/vehicle routes (cross-region).
- **Liquids** (distinct system) carried water (Water Hole) → **pipes + mechanical Pump** → direct
  pipe-fed consumers + barrels → **pressure/range + Booster Pumps**. Water is a liquid: never on belts.
- **Construction** logistics-driven (builders haul materials from storage) + visible **builder
  slots** + **Construction Yards** scale the builder cap.
- **Population** demand engine: food/water + age-tiered **comfort goods** → **Happiness** →
  productivity & growth; **Prosperity** score + **Rank**; **Monument** = win goal.
- **World/geography** biome `TerrainGrid` (Plains/Forest/Hills/Water); **water is a hard barrier**
  (no walking/building/belts) crossed by **Bridges**; **rivers** divide regions; water terrain is
  the liquid source. **Big world** (~400 units) with far frontier resources (finite ore/gems).
- **Power** global supply/demand + brownouts from the Industrial age (Coal Generator burns charcoal).

## Controls
WASD/arrows move (Shift sprint) · mouse-wheel zoom · **M** overview · **B** build menu (accordion
categories + Recent) · **G** Guide · **H** help · **N** hide minimap · Space pause · click a
building to manage · **X** demolish · **C** copy selected · **R** rotate (belt / building output) ·
hover anything for a name tooltip.

**Sandbox/testing hotkeys:** **F1** +500 of every resource · **F2** +5 people · **F3** advance age ·
**F4** free/instant build · **F5** game speed · **F7** toggle local/global production · **F8** reveal
whole map · **F9** toggle stored-only economy.

## Dev notes
- **Blind-build discipline:** the assistant can't run Unity — edits are brace-checked + reference-
  grepped before each commit; built in small chunks; the user recompiles and reports Console errors.
- **Repo:** private GitHub, default branch `main`. Auth via a Personal Access Token in the OS
  credential manager (no secrets committed). Per-repo commit identity: `Caveman Dev`.
- Keep the repo *outside* OneDrive so Unity's `Library/` cache isn't synced.
